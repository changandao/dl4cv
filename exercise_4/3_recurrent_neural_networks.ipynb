    "====================\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will work with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). A RNN is class of neural networks where the output not only depends on the current input but also on previous inputs along a given input sequence. This allows to exhibit temporal dynamic behaviour and contextual information in a sequence. Common applications for RNN are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- time series analysis\n",
    "- speech recognition\n",
    "- machine translation\n",
    "- image captioning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal of this exercise\n",
    "========\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise notebook should help you to experiment how recurrent neural networks are implemented, trained, and used for computer vision problems. Therefore, this notebook is structured as follows:\n",
    "1. Implement your own simple RNN class in Pytorch.\n",
    "2. Explore the backpropagation of the gradients in the RNN and discuss the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "3. Implement your own LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) Network and show that this architecture improves the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "4. Build a RNN classifier for the MNIST dataset and train your model.\n",
    "5. Tune the hyperparameters of your model and submit your best model to the server to get bonus points.\n",
